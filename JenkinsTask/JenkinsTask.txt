Jenkins Task.

I have configured Jenkins job in my local machine and another job connecting the git repository of WebTesting.
But could not host it.

Here, I am describing the steps I did:

1.I have installed Jenkins and Opened Jenkins from cmd:

java -jar jenkins.war --enable-future-java   (as java version was not supporting)

2.Opened Jenkins in browser and logged in using admin credentials:

http://localhost:8080/

3.At first I moded to manage plugins to install all maven and testng-results plugins

4.After installation, restarted the Jenkins.

5.From dashboard, I clicked New Item

6.Gave a sample name of the Jenkins Job Project and Selected Maven Project and Clicked OK, Configure page opened up

7.Added description

8.Under source code management, I added git repo url and branch name (for local I did not select this option)

9.Under the Build menu, I gave the root POM location and gave a command under Goals and Options: clean install

10.Under the post build actions menu, I chose publish testNG results option

11.Clicked apply and then Ok to save the configuration.

12.Then clicked Build Now from the Job dashboard and the build started.

13.After the completion of build, test results are found in the dashboard or Test Results menu.


I have attached the screenshots of my dashboard page and the Test results page.
